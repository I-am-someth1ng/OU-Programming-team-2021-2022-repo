This folder is for completed solutions to problems we work on during meetings (you must be able to pass all tests on whatever platform the problem is on).

When submitting code here, make sure to include the following information somewhere in your file:
-Your name
-A link to the problem (or how to get to the problem)
-Any flaws with the program (high memory usage, slow runtime, if any) 
-Reasonable amount of comments describing how the code works
