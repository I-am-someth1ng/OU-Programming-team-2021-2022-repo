This folder is for any incomplete solutions to problems worked on during meetings (code either does not run or gives an incorrect solution.)

When submitting code here, make sure to include the following information somewhere in your file:
- Your name
- A link to the problem (or how to get to the problem)
- What exactly makes the code incomplete (compile errors, runtime errors, returns wrong solution, etc..)
- Ideas on how to properly complete your code (optional)
- Reasonable amount of comments describing how the code works (or how it should work)
